{"name":"Nezu","tagline":"rails inspired amqp application framework","body":"Nezu\r\n====\r\nNezu is a rails inspired simple amqp app framework. Right now it is pretty much a work in progress though we hope that it will do the job here at talkyoo.net.\r\nIt has two major modes of usage:\r\n\r\n  1. nezu new /path/to/your/app\r\n    generates an app-skeleton\r\n\r\n  2. (bundle exec) nezu run\r\n    inside your app folder starts your application and subscribes all your consumers to their appropriate queues\r\n\r\n  3. Start\r\n     amqp-consume --queue=\"test.pong.dev\" cat\r\n     in other shell\r\n\r\n  4. Do\r\n     amqp-publish --routing-key=test.your_app_name.dev --body='{\"__action\":\"ping\",\"__reply_to\":\"test.pong.dev\",\"test\":23}'\r\n     in 3rd shell, now you should see the result:\r\n     {\"test\":23,\"__action\":\"ping_result\"}\r\n     in the output of amqp-consume an debug messages in \"nezu run\" output\r\n\r\n*BIGFATALPHAWARNING:*\r\n This hasn`t been fully tested yet. So if your working on a nuclear plant or so, go back to sleep this will be a lower risk\r\n\r\nThis Software is released under the Terms of General Public License.
