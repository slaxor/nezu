Nezu
====
Nezu is a rails inspired simple amqp app framework. Right now it is pretty much a work in progress though we hope that it will do the job here at talkyoo.net.
It has two major modes of usage:

  1. nezu new /path/to/your/app
    generates an app-skeleton

  2. (bundle exec) nezu run
    inside your app folder starts your application and subscribes all your consumers to their appropriate queues

 This hasn`t been fully tested yet. So if your working on a nuclear plant or so, go back to sleep this will be a lower risk
